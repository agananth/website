I am a software engineer at Google, where I work in Core Machine Learning on LaMDA training and serving infrastructure and enhancing model interpretability and trustworthiness.

I have both ML research and industry experience. My career goal is to work at bridging the two: apply cutting-edge ML research innovations to solve real-world problems that improve human wellbeing.
This [MIT Technology Review opinion article](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/18/1007196/ai-research-machine-learning-applications-problems-opinion/), which highlights that many AI researchers
do not highly value real-world applications of research, surprised me. Of course, new research that seeks to advance AI knowledge must be evaluated against older research using standard benchmark datasets.
But ultimately I strongly believe that the value of AI advancements must be in how much they can help us as people with real-world problems. [DeepMind Applied](https://www.deepmind.com/about/applied) has some
especially inspiring projects.
